            Catch an idea üí°! To check whether two squares (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) are reachable from each other in a single bishop move, the expression abs(r1-r2)==abs(c1-c2) checks that the horizontal distance between those squares equals their vertical distance, which is both necessary and sufficient for those squares  to lie on  the same diagonal. This way you don‚Äôt have  to separately rewrite  the essentially identical block of logic four times, but one test handles all four diagonal directions in one swoop.
